# BankOnDiscord
or 
# BankBot
Allows Companies to include CloudCoin Banks on their Discord Servers.

This program is a Discord Bot that runs on a Discord Server. The idea is that many companies can have their own Discord Banks. 

## BankBot Commands
To talk to the Bank Bot, the user types in "/bank". Then the user will be prompted for a command. Here are the commands available. All commands should be case insensitive including the parameters. 

1. [help](README.md#help)

2. [deletewallet](README.md#deletewallet)

3. [showcoins](README.md#showcoins)

4. [deposit](README.md#deposit)

5. [withdraw](README.md#withdraw)

6. [move](README.md#move)

7. [pay](README.md#pay)

8. [statement](README.md#statement)

9. [convert](README.md#convert)

10. We will be adding commands that support NFTs later including createNFT, deleteNFT, validateNFT etc.

## HELP
Returns a list of all the commands possible with explanations and uses.

Sample Request completed at the Discord chat box. Note the user types in "/bank" then gets a prompt.
```
/bank help
```
Sample Response:
```
Commands available:
* help (returns commands and instructions)
* deletewallet (Deletes the user's wallet if it is empty. This is good for privacy reasons.)
...more commands
```


## DELETEWALLET
Deletes the user's wallet. 

Request:
```
/bank deletewallet
```

Returns: 
```
Wallet Deleted
```
or 
```
Your Wallet Must Be Empty to be Deleted. Withdraw your Coins first.
```

## SHOWCOINS
Shows all the coins that are in the user's wallet. This number includes coins in the Bank folder and in the Fracked folder. 

Request
```
/bank showcoins
```

Returns an integer. Example:
```
33
```

## DEPOSIT
This command will upload a coin file. I am not sure how the file will be uploaded. I assume that the file would be uploaded at the same time as the command is issued or it would be the next file. It could be that the user sends the coin to the Bot and it is put into the user's Import folder. Then the user issues the "deposit" command and all the files in the Import folder are imported. 
 Maybe the program will ask them to attach an image?

Request:
```
/bank deposit
```
Response:
```
Please attach an image with a .bin, .png or .stack extenstion that holds CloudCoins.
```
User then attaches a file. But, maybe they can attach a file with the first request and the stop above is not needed. 

The return will include the outcome and the receipt. Something like:
```
Coins Attempted: 1
Coins Authentic: 1

DETAILS: 
Receipt: 162e62e2484204d38cef95c8e5630ecf

Pownstring : ppppppppppppppppppppppppp

```
if something goes wrong it could return:
```
.stack files are legacy coins that can be converted at the rate of 85.125 to one. Please use the convert command instead. 
or
File was coorupted. Coins were not imported.
or
File extension not supported. Please upload .bin or .png files.
```

## WITHDRAW
Brings the coin into the chat in the form of a PNG image and removes them from the wallet.

This command must specify the amount to withdraw. Here is an example of the command to withdraw 30 coins:
```
/bank withdraw 30
```
A PNG will be returned. 

## MOVE
Moves coins from one person's wallet to another person's wallet.

```

```
## PAY
